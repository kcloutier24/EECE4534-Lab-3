## PWM Animation Driver

Now we the enhance the driver to provide an LED animation option in
addition to the constant PWM signal implemented in 3.1.

In order to accomplish that, we will be using a High-Resolution Timer
(`hrtimer`) see [early introduction](https://lwn.net/Articles/167897/).
This is a kernel high resolution timer which will periodically call a
function that you will register. This function will adjust the LED
brightness, based on the definitions from sysfs (see
Table below). The concept of a timer callback
is similar to a periodic interrupt request.

The PWM animation driver will support both, a constant PWM output (which
has already been implemented in the previous issue) as well as an animation mode, which
repeatedly increases and decreases the PWM duty cycle. Follow the steps
detailed below to complete the assignment:

1.  Start with the code from lab 3.1. To track the animation work
    separately, create a feature branch "animation" of your (also needed
    for submission). To create a new `git` branch and immediately switch
    to it, use: `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME`. To switch between
    branches, also use the `checkout` command:
    `git checkout OTHER_BRANCH`.

2.  Expand the `esl_axitimer_control_store` and
    `esl_axitimer_status_show` functions for the additional value
    "animation". Define an additional bit in the flag to keep track if
    animation is running. Implement logic to detect that the animation
    mode is enabled (print animation start for debugging) and animation
    mode is disabled (print animation stop). Writing "animation"
    repeatedly into the *control* sysfs file should not start the
    animation again. Later, we will replace the print statements with
    starting/stopping the timer. Validate the functionality of the added
    control/status option.

3.  Modify the esl_axitimer_instance struct, adding an instance of
    [hrtimer](https://static.lwn.net/kerneldoc/driver-api/basics.html#c.hrtimer).
    Add variables for `an_duty_l`, `an_duty_h`, and `an_duration` and
    initialize them to meaningful defaults (e.g. 0, 100, 1000).
    **Note:** the sysfs interface to control `an_duty_l` and `an_duty_h`
    is optional. If not implementing those interfaces, just fix
    `an_duty_l` at 0 and `an_duty_h` at 100.

4.  Implement the timer callback function `esl_axitimer_animate`. To get
    started with debugging, just have this function issue a printk.

5.  In the `esl_axitimer_probe` function, initialize the instanceâ€™s
    hrtimer:

    1.  Initialize the timer struct using the function
        [`hrtimer_init`](https://static.lwn.net/kerneldoc/driver-api/basics.html#c.hrtimer_init)

    2.  Define the call-back by setting the *function* member of the
        hrtimer struct to `esl_axitimer_animate`

6.  Start the timer in `esl_axitimer_control_store` when animation mode
    is enabled:

    1.  The function
        [`hrtimer_start`](https://static.lwn.net/kerneldoc/driver-api/basics.html#c.hrtimer_start)
        argument *tim* defines the interval in *nanoseconds* when the
        timer expires (callback function is called). Calculate a
        suitable hrtimer interval. Consider that *an_duration* defines
        how long a complete animation takes (from low to high and back
        to low). During that time, the duty cycle needs to be updated
        many times to create a smooth animation. Describe the
        dimensioning and reasoning for your hrtimer interval in your
        post-lab. Save the value of the interval in a variable in the
        `struct axitimer_instance` for later use.

    2.  Call the `hrtimer_start` function. To get a value of type
        `ktime_t`, use the
        [`ktime_set`](https://static.lwn.net/kerneldoc/driver-api/basics.html#ktime_set)
        function with the calculated value. Start the timer in the
        **relative** mode.

    Compile and validate that the timer callback function is called.

7.  With the current implementation, the timer callback is called only
    once. Extend the callback function `esl_axitimer_animate` rearm the
    timer. Call the function
    [`hrtimer_forward_now`](https://static.lwn.net/kerneldoc/driver-api/basics.html#c.hrtimer_forward_now)
    to re-schedule the timer, using the interval that you calculated
    beforehand.

    **HINT:** Inside the hrtimer callback function you will need to get 
    direct access to your instance data stucture. To extract the 
    instance pointer use the `container_of` method as shown in the 
    code snippet below. 
    Use the reference to the instance object to set and read 
    flags and other values.
    
    
    ```c
      // retrieve esl_axitimer_instance object from timer argument
      // TODO: substitute MEMBER_NAME for the actual member name of the hrtimer object in
      // your esl_axitimer_instance implementation.
      struct esl_axitimer_instance* inst = container_of(timer,
                                                        struct esl_axitimer_instance,
                                                        MEMBER_NAME);
    ```

    Compile and validate that the timer callback function is called
    periodically. Use a very long *an_duration* to get prints about
    every half second.

8.  Implement canceling the hrtimer when the animation is disabled or
    the driver is removed. Use
    [`hrtimer_cancel`](https://static.lwn.net/kerneldoc/driver-api/basics.html#c.hrtimer_cancel).
    Validate the functionality.

9.  <span id="noSharedVar" label="noSharedVar"></span> Implement the
    code that performs the animation in `esl_axitimer_animate`.
    Gradually change the duty cycle to create the animation. Keep track
    if duty cycle is being increased or decreased using the state
    machine in Figure below. Keep track of
    the current state through a member in the instance data structure.
    To avoid race conditions, do not share the pre-existing `flags`
    member to store this flag.

    Validate the animation, validate start and stop of animation.

10. Implement the *an_duration*t sysfs file functionality. Validate its
    functionality.

11. Optional: Implement additional attributes (`an_duty_l, an_duty_h`)
    as described in the SysFS Table. Validate that the
    configuration is working properly.


In this issue reflect on challenges faced and solutions in realizing the steps above. 

In post-lab extend the README.md (on the main branch) over the basic version to include 
the animation functionality and interface. Refernce the branch on which this feature is available. 
Add a figure that visualizes the animation
and describe it. If needed, add a known issues section to the README if there are some remaining challenges.
