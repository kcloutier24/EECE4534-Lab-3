## Additional Post-Lab Questions

This lab aims to shape the 'report' portion as a project README.md 
(on the main branch).

Rename the current `README.md` into `LabInstructions.md`. 
Create a new README.md for your report 
(and include a link to the `LabInstructions.md` in your overview text). 

To get started, answer all questions mentioned  
in the individual issues (especially see the bottom portion of the issues). 

In addition, answer the following questions: 

1.  The previous issue (#3) suggested to use a
    separate variable for the timer callback tracking UP/Down to avoid
    race conditions when using the common flags. Briefly answer the
    following items in a Design Discussion section of the README 
    (on the main branch):

    1.  Why would not separating the flags potentially generate a race
        condition?

    2.  In the code, show two places where a race condition might arise.

    3.  What could you do to prevent a race condition, even if sharing
        the same variable for storing all the flags?
