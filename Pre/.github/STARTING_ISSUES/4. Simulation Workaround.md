### Simulation Workaround

Multiple AXI timers exist in the system. To select the timers that should be PWM timers, 
we have marked one timer with an additional attribute `esl,pwm-timer`. This attribute is 
present only on the physical ZedBoard (not on QEMU). 

After loading the driver with  ```insmod```, the kernel will finds compatible timers. 
However, each instance will be skipped as the `esl,pwm-timer` attribute is missing.  

Modify the driver code so that this restriction is ignored for debugging on QEMU.
