## 1. Validate Skeleton 

To get started, validate the environment. Compile the unmodified skeleton and upload. 

If compilation fails, check if you have done the kernel module preparation step in the installation instructions for in [EnvironmentHome](https://neu-ece-4534.github.io/EnvironmentHome.html#2-installing-development-tools-on-linux).

Upload the new kernel module to the [QEMU Virtual Zedboard](https://neu-ece-4534.github.io/ARMXCompSim). Set the IP for the board according to [connections](https://neu-ece-4534.github.io/connection.html).

~~~
make modules_upload

Load the driver with ```insmod kpwm.ko```, check for kernel messages and unload it it with ```rmmod kpwm```.  

**HINT:** Watch for messages printed in the main QEMU window to check that everything is working as intended, or use ```dmesg``` for the same purpose.

## 2. Adjust for PWM Timers

Examine the skeleton code provided in **kpwm.c** AND the device tree source file **pl.dtsi**, which contains descriptions for all the memory-mapped hardware devices available in the labs. Search for the timers descriptions.

In the device tree source, identify the correct compatibility string so that your driver code will get loaded against the AXI Timer peripherals. See the [short overview](https://lwn.net/Articles/448502/) and a [tutorial](http://xillybus.com/tutorials/device-tree-zynq-3) for additional background. Look up the device in the device tree (pl.dtsi), e.g. search a timer with the correct base address. Insert the correct string in the driver skeleton, compile and ensure that the timers are found upon loading of the driver.
