## Theory and code analysis

### PRE3.1

Inspect the skeleton code. In the *esl_axitimer_probe()* function, there is a call to the *platform_get_resource()* function. What does this call do? Insert comments in the source file (**kwpm.c**) explaining the reason for the call. Commit your changes referencing this issue. 


### PRE3.2

Also in the *esl_axitimer_probe()* function, the code calls the kernel function *devm_ioremap_resource()*. What does this call accomplish? Why is it necessary? Insert comments in **kwpm.c** near the function call, explaining your reasoning. Commit your changes referencing this issue. 

### PRE3.3

When is the function *esl_axitimer_state_show()* called? What gets returned when the PWM controller is idle? Put your answer and comments in the source file, above the function. Commit your changes referencing this issue. 

**HINT:** Which file operation triggers the call?

### PRE3.4

How is the PWM controller sysfs file *control* defined and linked to the function *esl_axitimer_control_store()*?  Put your answer and comments in the source file, above the function. Commit your changes referencing this issue.
